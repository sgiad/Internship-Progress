Universal Wiki Converter (UWC) is a great tool that was developed by Altasian to
transfer wiki content and pages to Confluence which would be easier than going 
through that process manually. Almost all of the automation is done through the scripts
that are already built-in within the software itself. There are steps on how to download
the software and get it work online and can be found easily.
