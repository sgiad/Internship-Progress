Here are the notes for Wednesday June, 15

Alex explained to us the real concept of jspwiki and how we use it. He also asked us 
to do some other readings which I will be recording the notes of here.

First of all, I have installed notepad++ and 7zip on my personal laptop. I am now about
to start reading more about .jar and .war.

.jar files (Java Archives) are basically files that contain libraries, resources, and
accessories files like property files.

.war files (Web Application Archives) are basically files that contain the web 
application that can be deployed on any servlet/jsp container. They contain jsp, html,
java script and other files that are necessary for the development of web application.

Universal Wiki Converter (UWC) is a great tool that was developed by Altasian to
transfer wiki content and pages to Confluence which would be easier than going 
through that process manually. Almost all of the automation is done through the scripts
that are already built-in within the software itself. There are steps on how to download
the software and get it work online and can be found easily. 

In the article (Help:HowToWiki) on wikipedia, there is an explaination on how to convert
word documents to wiki pages using different tools such as VisualEditor, Word2MediaWikiPlus,
LibreOffice, Openoffice, and some extensions that can be added to Microsoft Office. These
tools are very useful especially when we are talking about converting huge documents that 
consist of 300+ pages.

There are other articles on the Internet that kind of explain the converting process step
by step which is actually good and very helpful. I am still reading some of them to gain
more knowledge about the whole converting process.
