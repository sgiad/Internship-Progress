Things I have learned during my Internship: 

1. Git:- Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in
2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering
number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial project
s as well as open source.

2. GitHub:- is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While
Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides
access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management
tools for every project.
