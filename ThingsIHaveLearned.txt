Things I have learned during my Internship: 

1. Git:- Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in
2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering
number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial project
s as well as open source.

2. GitHub:- is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While
Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides
access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management
tools for every project.

3. API - Application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for 
building software applications. An API specifies how software components should interact and 
APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.

4. BitBucket - is a web-based hosting service for projects that use either the Mercurial 
(since launch) or Git (since October 2011) revision control systems. Bitbucket offers both 
commercial plans and free accounts.
