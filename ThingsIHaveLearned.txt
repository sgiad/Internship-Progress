Things I have learned during my Internship: 

1. Git:- Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in
2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering
number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial project
s as well as open source.
