Sunady, June 12

It was a busy weekend so I did not have the chance to make a commit until now. Last week went very well and I got to learn about git and github. I am still no expert but I can say that I know the basics and will to learn as much as I can.

On Friday, I installed eclipse and some extensions for OpenOffice. However, I still do not have OpenOffice because I was asked to install it manually. By manually I mean cloning on an open source and build it.

On Monday, I will start the day by going through the recent changes on our wiki and try to improve them. Also, I will try to finish installing the required softwares so I can start working on my project.

Monday, June 13

It was a good day overall. I started the day by going over the recend changes on our wiki and improved some of them. After that, I improved minor things on Wikipedia but some changes were not accepted for some reason!

The Ice Cream Social was good and I think it brings all of the staff together. It was a blast. Now it is almost the end of the day and I am ready to go home so I can just chill for awhile until I get to eat because I am starving.

Wednesday, June 15

Today was a good day overall. I finally got to install jspwiki using git which was a relief. I spent some time reading about jar, war, and converting words documents to wiki pages. I also learned about wiki syntax because I will be doing much of that in the coming days. Overall, today was great and now I am just enjoying my evening with the family.
