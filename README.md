Sunady, June 12

It was a busy weekend so I did not have the chance to make a commit until now. Last week went very well and I got to learn about git and github. I am still no expert but I can say that I know the basics and will to learn as much as I can.

On Friday, I installed eclipse and some extensions for OpenOffice. However, I still do not have OpenOffice because I was asked to install it manually. By manually I mean cloning on an open source and build it.

On Monday, I will start the day by going through the recent changes on our wiki and try to improve them. Also, I will try to finish installing the required softwares so I can start working on my project.
