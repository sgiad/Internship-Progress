I went over some recent changes on the wiki and then spent some time looking for a way to install openoffice through git. I still cannot do it. I didn't work on the documents that were sent to us because I'm not sure if I should start from beginning or not. Also, I tried to find an online converter that I can use to convert doc/html to wiki but couldn't find any.
